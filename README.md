# EnergyTariffChange

## Introduction

Welcome to the EnergyTariffChange repository! This project focuses on the analysis and simulation of energy tariffs using computational methods. It features a variety of Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets designed to model and predict future energy tariffs based on historical data and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Repository Contents

- **RES/**: Contains resources and reference materials.
- **Distribucion_Tarifas.py**: A Python script for distributing tariffs.
- **MCSimulacion - Tarifas a futuro.xlsx**: An Excel file for creating future tariff simulations using Monte Carlo methods.
- **MonteCarloSim.py**: A Python script for running Monte Carlo simulations on energy tariffs.
- **STD.xlsx**: An Excel file containing standard data.
- **Tarifas a futuro - Metodo Montecarlo.xlsx**: An Excel file detailing the Monte Carlo method for future tariffs.
- **Tarifas.py**: A Python script for processing tariff data.
- **Tarifas.xlsx**: An Excel file containing tariff data and processing information.
- **the_mandalorian_bell.mp3**: An MP3 file included for data processing purposes.

## Getting Started
